### About

LipoLogs is a small, lightweight and mobile-friendly web app that helps log the usage and data of your lipos to make managing them a breeze. This site is made to help ease the struggle of keeping track of all your batteries and, while still in beta, might branch out into other drone-related tools.

### Usage

[**Simply go here**](http://opticulex.ddns.net/lipologs/?ref=github) and create an instant account with just a username & password.

### Development

LipoLogs is designed with raw [Bootstrap 4.0](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS and JS for efficiency and runs on a PHP/MySQL Apache server. For the most part it is single page and uses query strings to load page content. The prime focus of the project is to make something extremely lightweight and simplistic, while being feature-full and mobile-friendly. For mobile ease of use the site uses [FeatherIcons](https://feathericons.com/) in place of text.

### API
LipoLogs has an API in development which will allow usage or integration by other websites and apps to have full control over your account usage. [Try out the API](http://opticulex.ddns.net/lipologs/api/) or [read the API guide here](http://opticulex.ddns.net/lipologs/?p=help&h=api).
